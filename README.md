# css-raptorize
Inspired from the original jQuery Raptorize plugin by ZURB. This version however does not use jQuery, but fancy css3 animations.
Original: https://github.com/zurb/jquery-raptorize

It uses the excellent konami-js library to detect the konami code in vanilla js.

## What you need
To get raptors on your page, include rawr.js and rawr.css in your html.
You will also need raptor.png, rawr.mp3, and rawr.ogg.

In case you want to be sneaky, you can also just include inline/rawr.js, which has all above listed files inlined in its source code.
